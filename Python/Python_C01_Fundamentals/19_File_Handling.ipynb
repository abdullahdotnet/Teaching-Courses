    "# File Handling\n",
    "File handling means reading and writing data using files. We use files to store data. One reason is that once we close our program, all of the data is lost and when we re-run the program, it starts from the beginning. But we can use files to store data even after the program is closed. We can also manipulate the files using programs. We will be seeing how we can do that using Python. There are many types of file but we can categories them in 2 categories just for our simplicity.\n",
    "1. Text files\n",
    "2. Binary file\n",
    "\n",
    "These types includes many other types of files. But for now, we will only see `Text Files`. File handling also depends on the structure of the file. There are many types of files. You may have seen extensions after the file names like `.xlsx` in Excel files, `.txt` in text files and many more types exist. In our course, we will be covering 2 types of text files:  \n",

    "### Working with files\n",
    "To use the file either for reading or writing, we need to open the file in different **`modes`**. For reading, we will open it in the reading mode and for writing, we will use writing mode. Some other modes also exist but we may see it later. After doing our work with the file, it is a good practice to <u>close</u> the file as well so the file can be used for normal functioning. To open a file, we use the `open()` function. The first argument is the file name and the second argument is the file mode in which we want to open it. By default, if we don't mention the mode, it will open in `read` mode. While opening the file, you will also write a variable. We will be using that variable for doing anything with the file. That will be a <u>pointer</u> for the file.  \n",
    "`file_pointer = open('file_name.txt',mode)`  \n",
    "In the above syntax shows how we open the file for reading and writing. `file_pointer` is just a variable. You can write any variable name here but we will be using that variable for all of the operations on that file. Then there is file name as a string. After that there is `mode`. Instead of it, you will write `'r'` for read mode and `'w'` for write mode. There are other modes as well, we may see them later.  \n",
    "After doing your working with files, you should close the file as well.  \n",
    "`file_pointer.close()`  \n",
    "**Important Note:** Whether you read or write data inside the file, you will deal with only **strings**.  \n",
