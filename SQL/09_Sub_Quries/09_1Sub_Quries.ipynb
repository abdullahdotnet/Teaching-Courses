    "## Usage\n",
    "Subqueries are a powerful tool in SQL that allow you to perform complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps. They can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Filtering data based on results from another query: For instance, finding all orders placed by customers who live in a specific state.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Aggregating data and using the results in conditions to fetch from other tables: An example is finding the customer name who has placed the order with the highest total_amount.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Comparing data from multiple tables: This can be helpful for tasks like finding all the customers who have never placed any order.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Joining tables with complex conditions: This can be useful for scenarios where the join condition relies on results from another table. For example: Finding customers who have purchased above average orders"
