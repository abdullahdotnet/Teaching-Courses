    "Union is a set operation in SQL that allows you to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set. The result set of a union query contains all the rows that are returned by the individual queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for the union operation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The union operation removes duplicate rows from the result set. If you want to include duplicate rows, you can use the `UNION ALL` operator.\n",
